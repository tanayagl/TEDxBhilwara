<h1> ABOUT </h1>
<h1> What is TED?</h1>
  <p>TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a conference in California 1984, TED has grown to support those world-changing ideas with many initiatives.</p>
  <p>At a TED conference, the world&#8217;s leading thinkers and doers are asked to give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes or less. TED speakers have included Roger Ebert, Sheryl Sandberg, Bill Gates, Elizabeth Gilbert, Benoit Mandelbrot, Philippe Starck Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Brian Greene, Isabel Allende and former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown.</p>
  <p>On TED.com, talks from TED conferences are shared with the world for free as TED Talks videos. A new TED Talk is posted every weekday. Through the Open Translation Project, TED Talks are subtitled by volunteers worldwide. Through our distribution networks, TED Talks are shared on TV, radio, Netflix and many websites.</p>
  <p>The TEDx initiative grants free licenses to people around the world to organize TED-style events in their communities with TED Talks and live speakers. Selected talks from these events are also turned into TED Talks videos.</p>
  <p>The annual TED Prize grants $1 million to an exceptional individual with a wish to change the world. The TED Fellows program helps world-changing innovators from around the globe to become part of the TED community and, with its help, amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities. TED-Ed creates short video lessons by pairing master teachers with animators, for use in classroom instruction or independent learning.</p>

<h1> What is TEDx?</h1>
  <p>About TEDx, x = independently organized event</p>
  <p>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)</p>

<h1> TEDxBhilwara </h1>
  <p>TEDxBhilwara shares the same passion as TED. This unique initiative is undertaken to spread your ideas all across the globe. Our objective is to reach out and inspire people with “Ideas Worth Sharing” which has the potential to help people make a strong difference in their lives. We also aim to allow people to come together, make connections and share knowledge. We have initiated this because we believe, everybody has got his/her story to tell and the beautiful part is, each one is different from the other.</p>
  <p>Another objective of bringing this platform in city Bhilwara is to open the minds of Bhilwara people to broader perspectives of world and their surroundings. We do not want to change their perception completely but let them constantly learn about new ideas and perspectives.</p>
  <p>This would help in city&#8217;s growth as well and give a different identity to city Bhilwara because the initiative is a unique one with a purpose of spreading knowledge from local community. Through this TEDx event, we aim to help young people step towards building a local community to work collaboratively with active members of society in order to become expert learners and foster enriching conversations of changing tomorrow.</p>
